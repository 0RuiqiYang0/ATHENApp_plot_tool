#### This is a Python package for ATHENA++ visualization inspred by <a href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/athena/wiki/Plotting-Scripts#plot_slicepy">athena++ plotting scripts</a>
This package takes a 2D color plot of a single quantity from an Athena++ `.athdf` file. 3D data will be sliced, averaged, or summed as requested. A stream plot of a vector field from the same file can be overlayed. The script is best used in Cartesian coordinates. Plots are made in coordinate space like x-y or y-z plane. Averaging and summing are done in a naive way so that the package will not be able to handle AMR(Adaptive Mesh Refinement) output data. Stream plots are similarly done as simply as possible, without accounting for subtleties with vector bases.
